## Brief biography
I am Jasur. I was born in 1994 in Namangan, Uzbekistan and now live in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. After 6-years' education and half-year work experience in the field of economics, I made a "now-or-never" decision, changing my profession to web developer. I knew, in the beginning it was hard, but true way. From that day, I am trying be a better frontend developer.

## Web technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sass
* Git
* Javascript (not much)

## Code examples

```
function sumOfMult(num, div) {
  let times = Math.floor((num - 1 ) / div);
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 1; i <= times; i++) {
    sum += i * div
  }
  return sum
}

function solution(number) {
return sumOfMult(number, 3) + sumOfMult(number, 5) - sumOfMult(number, 15);
}
```
